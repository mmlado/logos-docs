# Gate program instructions with admin-authority

:::warning
This page is an early draft and may be incomplete or incorrect. Expect changes, missing prerequisites, and commands that might not work in your setup. We are actively working to complete and verify this content.
:::

`admin-authority` is a SPEL extension that adds a single transferable admin role to your LEZ program. The admin is the only account allowed to call admin-gated instructions. The role can be transferred to another signer or PDA, or renounced permanently. This page walks through using `admin-authority` from an app developer's perspective. If you are building a different extension, see [Build a SPEL extension library](build-a-spel-extension-library.md) instead.

## When to use it

Pick `admin-authority` when your program has:

- A configuration or policy account that only one party should mutate (`set_fee_bps`, `update_oracle_address`, `pause`).
- An emergency action that needs guarded access (`recover_funds`, `migrate_state`).
- A handoff scenario where ownership might rotate between parties over time.

If your program needs multi-party approval rather than single-admin gating, `admin-authority` is the wrong primitive, wait for `multisig-authority` (RFP-TBD) or compose admin-authority with a multisig PDA as the admin.

## Add the dependency

In your program's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
admin-authority = { git = "https://github.com/mmlado/spel-admin-authority" }
spel-framework  = { git = "https://github.com/logos-co/spel" }
nssa_core = { git = "https://github.com/logos-blockchain/logos-execution-zone.git", tag = "v0.2.0", package = "lee_core" }
borsh = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
```

All five are needed: the reference samples use exactly this set. `nssa_core` carries the on-chain account types, `borsh` encodes your state, and `serde` is required by the instruction plumbing even when your own types never touch it. The `admin-authority-macros` sub-crate is pulled in transitively. You do not need to declare it directly. The library README documents the framework revision each release is verified against.

After adding the dependencies, run `cargo fetch` once. The framework's extension scanner resolves your dependency graph with an offline metadata call, which fails deterministically for a fresh consumer whose git dependencies were never fetched.

## Annotate the module

If you started from `cargo new`, delete the default `fn main` first. The `#[lez_program]` macro generates the program's entry point, and the leftover stub collides with it as a duplicate `main`.

Add `#[admin_authority]` inside your `#[lez_program]` module:

```rust
use spel_framework::prelude::*;
use admin_authority::{admin_authority, require_admin};

#[lez_program]
#[admin_authority]
mod my_program {
    use super::*;

    #[instruction]
    pub fn create_pool(
        #[account(init, pda = literal("pool"))] pool: AccountWithMetadata,
        #[account(signer)] caller: AccountWithMetadata,
    ) -> SpelResult { /* ... */ }
}
```

That single annotation exposes three new instructions in your program's IDL:

| Instruction | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `admin_initialize` | Creates the admin Config PDA and installs the caller as the first admin. Must be called once after deployment. |
| `admin_transfer` | Replaces the current admin with a new signer or PDA. |
| `admin_renounce` | Zeros the admin permanently. Terminal, no recovery path. |

:::warning
**Initialization window.** Until `admin_initialize` is called, the admin Config PDA does not exist. Anyone who submits the first `admin_initialize` becomes the admin. Send it as the very next transaction after deployment to prevent a third party from claiming the role. Bundling with the deployment itself is not possible today because a LEZ deployment transaction carries no instructions.
:::

## Gate an instruction

Add `#[require_admin]` to any instruction that should only succeed when the caller is the current admin:

```rust
#[instruction]
#[require_admin]
pub fn set_fee_bps(
    #[account(mut, pda = literal("pool_config"))] mut config: AccountWithMetadata,
    new_fee_bps: u16,
) -> SpelResult {
    // Admin check has already run. Just mutate.
    todo!()
}
```

The gate needs two accounts, the `admin_config` PDA holding the current admin state and a signing `caller`. You do not have to write them: the framework injects both from metadata the library declares, and they appear in the IDL like declared parameters. Declaring them explicitly produces the same program:

```rust
#[instruction]
#[require_admin]
pub fn set_fee_bps(
    #[account(pda = literal("admin_config"))] admin_config: AccountWithMetadata,
    #[account(signer)] caller: AccountWithMetadata,
    #[account(mut, pda = literal("pool_config"))] mut config: AccountWithMetadata,
    new_fee_bps: u16,
) -> SpelResult {
    todo!()
}
```

If your instruction already has parameters by different names, point the gate at them with the inject-account names as keys: `#[require_admin(admin_config = my_cfg, caller = owner)]`. The framework also recognises declared parameters by role, a `#[account(signer)]` parameter or a PDA parameter with the matching seed is reused under its declared name instead of being injected twice.

## Become the first admin

`admin_initialize` takes no arguments. The signing caller becomes the admin (self-election). There is no candidate argument at initialize because the LEZ duplicate-account rule rejects a transaction listing the same account twice, so a caller could never also pass itself as candidate evidence.

```bash
spel --idl program-idl.json --program <program-id> -- \
    admin-initialize --caller <your-account-id>
```

To hand the role to a different keyholder or a PDA, initialize first and then call `admin_transfer`.

## Transfer admin to another party

`admin_transfer` requires the current admin to sign. It takes an `AdminCandidate` describing the new admin, paired with a matching `AccountWithMetadata` that proves the candidate on chain.

Two candidate shapes:

```rust
pub enum AdminCandidate {
    /// The new admin is a keyholder. Validated by checking the new account
    /// co-signed the transaction.
    Signer,
    /// The new admin is a program-owned PDA. Validated by deriving the address
    /// from (program_id, seed) and confirming the PDA exists on chain.
    Pda { program_id: ProgramId, seed: [u8; 32] },
}
```

```bash
spel --idl program-idl.json --program <program-id> -- \
    admin-transfer \
    --caller <current-admin-account-id> \
    --new-account <new-admin-account-id> \
    --candidate Signer
```

A `Signer` transfer needs the new admin's signature on the same transaction, which proves the keyholder consents. That means two parties sign one message, an off-chain co-signing exchange: export the partial transaction with the candidate named as a co-signer (`--export handover.json --co-signer <new-admin-account-id-hex>`), send the file to the candidate to run `spel sign`, then submit it. Without the second signature the sequencer drops the transaction.

After the transaction lands, the previous admin can no longer call gated instructions.

## Use a program (PDA) as the admin

To delegate admin authority to another program, for example a multisig, use `AdminCandidate::Pda` with the delegating program's ID and PDA seed. Payload variants are passed to the CLI as a one-key JSON object:

```bash
spel --idl program-idl.json --program <program-id> -- \
    admin-transfer \
    --caller <current-admin-account-id> \
    --new-account <pda-account-id> \
    --candidate '{"Pda": {"program_id": "<multisig-program-id>", "seed": "<32-byte-hex-seed>"}}'
```

The PDA must already exist on chain as a claimed account, an unclaimed candidate is rejected. When the multisig later wants to invoke a gated instruction on your program, it does so through a chained call and declares its admin PDA in `caller-pda-seeds`. LEZ verifies the seed and propagates `is_authorized = true` to your program; the `#[require_admin]` check then accepts the PDA as the legitimate admin. No private key is needed for the PDA, authorization comes from the seed delegation.

## Embedded mode, the admin slot inside your own account

Instead of a dedicated Config PDA, the admin slot can live inside one of your program's own accounts. Embedded mode is two declarations, each on the thing it describes: `#[admin_slot]` on the field that holds the slot, and `#[initialize]` on the instruction that creates the account. `#[initialize]` is a shorthand for the anchor attribute of every activated extension, here it stands for `#[admin_initialize]`, and the framework expands it before anything else runs. The module marker stays bare, and the offset is derived from the marked field:

```rust
#[account_type]
#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize, Clone, Debug)]
pub struct ProgramConfig {
    pub value: u64,           // bytes 0..8
    pub padding: [u8; 24],    // bytes 8..32
    #[admin_slot]
    pub admin: AdminConfig,   // bytes 32..64, the embedded slot
}

#[lez_program]
#[admin_authority]
mod my_program {
    use admin_authority::admin_initialize;

    #[initialize]
    #[instruction]
    pub fn initialize(
        #[account(init, pda = literal("program_config"))] mut config: AccountWithMetadata,
        #[account(signer)] signer: AccountWithMetadata,
    ) -> SpelResult {
        ProgramConfig { value: 0, padding: [0; 24], admin: AdminConfig::default() }
            .write_to(&mut config)?;
        // ...
    }
}
```

The `write_to` helper is yours to write, the library does not provide it. The reference sample uses this one:

```rust
impl ProgramConfig {
    fn write_to(&self, account: &mut AccountWithMetadata) -> Result<(), SpelError> {
        account.account.data = borsh::to_vec(self)
            .map_err(|_| SpelError::SerializationError { message: "encoding failed".into() })?
            .try_into()
            .map_err(|_| SpelError::SerializationError { message: "data too large".into() })?;
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

What changes:

- **No `admin_initialize` instruction.** Mark your own account-creating instruction with `#[initialize]` instead. The bootstrap is injected, the caller is installed as admin in the same transaction that creates the account, and the slot is born initialized, so the initialization window from the warning above does not exist in embedded mode. An account created without the bootstrap is born renounced, permanently.
- **`#[admin_slot]` declares the offset.** The field marker derives an `ADMIN_SLOT_OFFSET` const and a layout test, and the framework reads the slot through the const. A field added above the slot moves the derived offset with it instead of silently moving the window.
- **The declarations must agree.** A struct carrying `#[admin_slot]` with no fn carrying `#[admin_initialize]` refuses to build, the account would ship born renounced. An `#[admin_initialize]` fn with no marked field refuses too. Neither declaration is plain dedicated mode. The shorthand covers only the unambiguous shape, one `#[account(init)]` param on the fn. When the instruction creates several accounts, write the explicit attr and name the embedding one, `#[admin_initialize(admin_config = config)]`.
- **Everything retargets.** Gates read the slot at the declared offset from your account, `admin_transfer` and `admin_renounce` splice only the 32 byte window and leave your neighboring fields untouched, and the IDL shows your account wherever the dedicated PDA used to appear.
- **The offset is never in a transaction.** It compiles into the program. The IDL carries no offset argument, and writing `admin_config = ...` or `offset = ...` on the marker or on a gate by hand is a compile error.
- **One account fewer** on every gated transaction, the slot travels with state you were already passing.

The embedded `AdminConfig` field must have only fixed-size fields before it so the offset const can be derived. The library repository ships a reference sample (`admin-authority-sample-embedded`) with the layout, tests, and a committed dry-run walkthrough.

## Renounce admin permanently

```bash
spel --idl program-idl.json --program <program-id> -- \
    admin-renounce --caller <current-admin-account-id>
```

This writes `AccountId::default()` to the Config PDA. All future admin-gated instructions reject with an authorization error. There is no recovery path, design your program so renounce is only callable when permanent loss of mutability is the intended outcome (handoff to "immutable" governance, end of life, etc.).

## Verify your integration

After building your program, check that the admin instructions appear in the IDL:

```bash
spel generate-idl path/to/your/program/src/main.rs | jq '.instructions[].name'
```

Expected output includes:

```
"admin_initialize"
"admin_transfer"
"admin_renounce"
```

Plus your own instructions. A marker that matches no discoverable extension is a hard compile error naming the marker, so a broken setup refuses loudly rather than building without the trio. When you hit that error, the most common causes are:

- `admin-authority` not declared as a direct path or git dependency in your `Cargo.toml`. Transitive dependencies are never discovered.
- `#[admin_authority]` placed outside `#[lez_program]` rather than inside.
- Cached macro expansion, run `cargo clean -p <your-crate>` and rebuild.

## Security notes

- **Initialization window**, front-running is possible until the first `admin_initialize` lands. Send it immediately after deployment. Deploy-time bundling is not possible on LEZ today, a deployment transaction carries no instructions.
- **Renounce is terminal**, there is no recovery. Treat it as a one-way switch.
- **PDA admins via CPI**, the delegating program must declare its admin PDA in `caller-pda-seeds` for the gated call. LEZ verifies the seed; the admin check then trusts the propagated `is_authorized`.
- **Transfer history**, not recorded on chain in this release. The current admin is always readable from the Config PDA; historical transfers require an off-chain indexer.
