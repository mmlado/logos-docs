# Freeze program execution with freeze-authority

:::warning
This page is an early draft and may be incomplete or incorrect. Expect changes, missing prerequisites, and commands that might not work in your setup. We are actively working to complete and verify this content.
:::

`freeze-authority` is a SPEL extension that adds an emergency-stop primitive to your LEZ program. A designated freeze authority can pause all program execution (program-wide freeze) and block specific accounts from interacting (per-account freeze). The role can be transferred by the admin or renounced; while the program is frozen, only the freeze management carve-outs (unfreeze, authority transfer and renounce, per-account freeze edits), admin operations, and instructions you marked `#[freeze_exempt]` remain callable. This page walks through using `freeze-authority` from an app developer's perspective. If you are building a different extension, see [Build a SPEL extension library](build-a-spel-extension-library.md) instead.

`freeze-authority` depends on `admin-authority`. The admin governs the freeze authority slot; the freeze authority governs the frozen flags. See [Gate program instructions with admin-authority](admin-authority.md) for the admin layer.

## When to use it

Pick `freeze-authority` when your program needs:

- An emergency circuit breaker for incident response (`freeze` everything until the team can investigate).
- A blocklist for sanctioned or compromised accounts (`block` specific `AccountId`s while the rest of the program keeps running).
- Both layered — global pause plus per-account blocks for graduated response.

If your program needs a permanent pause with no recovery, use `admin_renounce` after deployment instead — freeze-authority is the wrong primitive for one-way upgrades.

## Add the dependency

In your program's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
admin-authority  = { git = "https://github.com/mmlado/spel-admin-authority" }
freeze-authority = { git = "https://github.com/mmlado/spel-freeze-authority" }
spel-framework   = { git = "https://github.com/logos-co/spel" }
nssa_core = { git = "https://github.com/logos-blockchain/logos-execution-zone.git", tag = "v0.2.0", package = "lee_core" }
borsh = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
```

The `admin-authority` dependency is required because freeze-authority composes with it, and both must be direct dependencies, the framework never discovers extensions transitively. `nssa_core` carries the on-chain account types, `borsh` encodes your state, and `serde` is required by the instruction plumbing. The `freeze-authority-macros` sub-crate is pulled in transitively.

After adding the dependencies, run `cargo fetch` once. The framework's extension scanner resolves your dependency graph with an offline metadata call, which fails deterministically for a fresh consumer whose git dependencies were never fetched. And if you started from `cargo new`, delete the default `fn main`, the `#[lez_program]` macro generates the program's entry point.

## Annotate the module

`freeze-authority` ships two modes: **auto** (default, F3-strict) and **manual** (explicit opt-in per instruction). Both require the admin marker so the freeze authority slot has an owner.

### Auto mode (recommended default)

Every dispatched instruction except the F3 carve-outs and admin operations is automatically gated by the freeze check. Consumers opt OUT per instruction with `#[freeze_exempt]`.

```rust
use spel_framework::prelude::*;
use admin_authority::admin_authority;
use freeze_authority::{freeze_authority, freeze_exempt, FreezeCandidate};

#[lez_program]
#[admin_authority]
#[freeze_authority]
mod my_program {
    use super::*;

    #[instruction]
    pub fn transfer(/* ... */) -> SpelResult { /* ... */ }   // auto-gated

    #[instruction]
    #[freeze_exempt]
    pub fn balance_of(/* ... */) -> SpelResult { /* ... */ } // exempt — callable while frozen
}
```

### Manual mode

Auto-wrap is disabled; the consumer applies `#[require_not_frozen]` only to instructions they want gated. F3 conformance becomes the consumer's responsibility.

```rust
use spel_framework::prelude::*;
use admin_authority::admin_authority;
use freeze_authority::{freeze_authority, require_not_frozen, FreezeCandidate};

#[lez_program]
#[admin_authority]
#[freeze_authority(manual)]
mod my_program {
    use super::*;

    #[instruction]
    #[require_not_frozen]
    pub fn transfer(/* ... */) -> SpelResult { /* ... */ }   // explicitly gated

    #[instruction]
    pub fn balance_of(/* ... */) -> SpelResult { /* ... */ } // NOT gated
}
```

That single annotation pair (plus `#[admin_authority]`) exposes seven new instructions in your program's IDL:

| Instruction | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `freeze_initialize` | Creates the freeze Config PDA and sets the first freeze authority. Requires admin signature. Must be called once after deployment. |
| `freeze_program` | Sets the program-wide frozen flag to true. Freeze authority only. |
| `freeze_program_release` | Sets the program-wide frozen flag to false. Freeze authority only. Callable while frozen. |
| `freeze_authority_transfer` | Replaces the current freeze authority with a new signer or PDA. Admin only. Callable while frozen. |
| `freeze_authority_renounce` | Vacates the freeze authority slot. Admin OR freeze authority self. Callable while frozen. Recoverable by admin via transfer. |
| `freeze_account(target)` | Sets per-account frozen flag to true for `target`. Freeze authority only. Callable while frozen. |
| `freeze_account_release(target)` | Sets per-account frozen flag to false for `target`. Freeze authority only. Callable while frozen. |

:::warning
**Initialization window.** Until `freeze_initialize` is called, the freeze Config PDA does not exist and no gates are active. Unlike `admin_initialize`, freeze initialization is NOT front-runnable — `freeze_initialize` requires the admin's signature. But it does require `admin_initialize` to have run first. Recommended pattern: submit `admin_initialize` and then `freeze_initialize` as the first two transactions after deployment, back to back. A LEZ transaction carries a single instruction, so they cannot share one.
:::

## Gate an instruction

In auto mode, all instructions are gated by default — you don't add any annotation. In manual mode, add `#[require_not_frozen]` to instructions you want gated:

```rust
#[instruction]
#[require_not_frozen]
pub fn transfer(
    #[account(mut, pda = literal("balance"))] mut balance: AccountWithMetadata,
    #[account(signer)] caller: AccountWithMetadata,
    amount: u64,
) -> SpelResult {
    /* your logic */
}
```

The injected gate performs two checks before the handler body runs:

1. **Program-wide check** — reads `freeze_config.is_frozen`. Rejects if true.
2. **Per-account check** — derives the PDA at `(program_id, "frozen", caller.account_id)` and reads `is_frozen`. Rejects if true. Missing PDA = not frozen.

Both checks pass for the call to proceed.

### Exempt an instruction from auto mode

Use `#[freeze_exempt]` to opt out per instruction:

```rust
#[instruction]
#[freeze_exempt]
pub fn balance_of(/* ... */) -> SpelResult { /* read-only, safe while frozen */ }
```

The framework reads `self_exempt_marker = "freeze_exempt"` from freeze-authority's Cargo metadata and skips the wrap for any function carrying the attribute.

## Initialize the freeze authority

`freeze_initialize` takes no candidate argument. The admin signs, and the admin becomes the initial freeze authority, the same self-election pattern as `admin_initialize`. Hand the role to a dedicated operations key or a PDA afterwards with `freeze_authority_transfer`.

```bash
spel --idl program-idl.json --program <program-id> -- \
    freeze-initialize --caller <admin-account-id>
```

## Freeze and unfreeze the program

```bash
# Freeze: rejects every interaction except the F3 carve-outs and admin operations.
spel --idl program-idl.json --program <program-id> -- \
    freeze-program --caller <freeze-authority-account-id>

# Unfreeze: restores normal operation.
spel --idl program-idl.json --program <program-id> -- \
    freeze-program-release --caller <freeze-authority-account-id>
```

Both require the current freeze authority to sign.

## Freeze and unfreeze a specific account

```bash
# Block account X from interacting with this program.
spel --idl program-idl.json --program <program-id> -- \
    freeze-account --caller <freeze-authority-account-id> --target <account-id-X-hex>

# Restore X's access.
spel --idl program-idl.json --program <program-id> -- \
    freeze-account-release --caller <freeze-authority-account-id> --target <account-id-X-hex>
```

`target` is a raw 32 byte argument, pass the account id as 64 hex characters, not base58.

When account X is frozen, any instruction in your program that's auto-gated or carries `#[require_not_frozen]` rejects when X is the signer. Other accounts are unaffected. Per-account state survives the program-wide frozen flag toggling — the two layers are independent. Releasing a target that is not currently frozen rejects with `account is not frozen`, so a release cannot silently create marker state for untouched accounts.

## Transfer freeze authority to another party

`freeze_authority_transfer` requires the admin to sign. It takes a `FreezeCandidate` describing the new holder, the same shape as `AdminCandidate`, paired with a `new_account` that carries the chain-state evidence:

```rust
pub enum FreezeCandidate {
    /// The new freeze authority is a keyholder. Validated by checking that
    /// the new account co-signed the transaction.
    Signer,
    /// The new freeze authority is a program-owned PDA. Validated by deriving
    /// the address from (program_id, seed) and confirming the PDA exists on chain.
    Pda { program_id: ProgramId, seed: [u8; 32] },
}
```

The slot can also be transferred from a Renounced (vacant) state, so admins can rotate the role with or without an interim vacancy:

```bash
spel --idl program-idl.json --program <program-id> -- \
    freeze-authority-transfer \
    --caller <admin-account-id> \
    --new-account <new-freeze-authority-account-id> \
    --candidate Signer
```

A `Signer` candidate is validated on chain by checking that the new holder co-signed the transaction, and the wallet only collects signatures for declared signer accounts. Collect the new holder's signature with the multi-signature exchange flow: export the partial transaction with the candidate named as a co-signer (`--export handover.json --co-signer <new-holder-account-id-hex>`), send the file to the candidate to run `spel sign`, then submit it. The single command above builds and submits directly, and the sequencer drops it unless the new holder's signature is attached.

## Use a program (PDA) as freeze authority

To delegate freeze authority to another program (e.g. a multisig or a circuit-breaker DAO), pass `FreezeCandidate::Pda`:

```bash
spel --idl program-idl.json --program <program-id> -- \
    freeze-authority-transfer \
    --caller <admin-account-id> \
    --new-account <pda-account-id> \
    --candidate '{"Pda": {"program_id": "<multisig-program-id>", "seed": "<32-byte-hex-seed>"}}'
```

When the multisig invokes `freeze_program` (or any freeze-authority-signed instruction), it does so through a chained call and declares its PDA in `caller-pda-seeds`. LEZ verifies the seed and propagates `is_authorized = true`; the gate accepts the PDA as the legitimate freeze authority.

## Renounce freeze authority

```bash
# Either the current admin OR the current freeze authority can sign.
spel --idl program-idl.json --program <program-id> -- \
    freeze-authority-renounce --caller <admin-or-freeze-authority-account-id>
```

Unlike admin renounce, this is NOT terminal. The freeze authority slot becomes vacant; the admin can repopulate it later via `freeze_authority_transfer`. While the slot is vacant, `freeze_program`, `freeze_program_release`, `freeze_account`, and `freeze_account_release` all fail. The program-wide `is_frozen` flag and per-account states are preserved at the moment of renounce — they don't reset.

If the admin has already been renounced first (terminal), the freeze slot becomes effectively permanent: there is no one to call `freeze_authority_transfer` to repopulate it. Plan the order of renounces carefully if you intend to commit to no-future-freeze.

## Embedded mode, the freeze slot inside your own account

Like admin-authority, the freeze state can live inside one of your program's own accounts instead of a dedicated Config PDA, and both extensions can share the same account at distinct offsets:

```rust
#[account_type]
#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize, Clone, Debug)]
pub struct ProgramConfig {
    pub value: u64,            // bytes 0..8
    pub padding: [u8; 24],     // bytes 8..32
    #[admin_slot]
    pub admin: AdminConfig,    // bytes 32..64
    #[freeze_slot]
    pub freeze: FreezeConfig,  // bytes 64..97
}

#[lez_program]
#[admin_authority]
#[freeze_authority]
mod my_program {
    use admin_authority::admin_initialize;
    use freeze_authority::freeze_initialize;

    #[initialize]
    #[instruction]
    pub fn initialize(
        #[account(init, pda = literal("program_config"))] mut config: AccountWithMetadata,
        #[account(signer)] signer: AccountWithMetadata,
    ) -> SpelResult {
        // write the struct with both slots defaulted; the admin
        // bootstrap is injected by the attribute
        // ...
    }
}
```

What changes:

- **No `freeze_initialize` instruction, an anchor attribute instead.** Mark your account-creating instruction with `#[initialize]`, the shorthand for every activated extension's anchor. Here it stands for both `#[admin_initialize]` and `#[freeze_initialize]`, expanded in marker order, and the explicit attrs keep working as the fallback. Freeze's anchor expands to nothing, it declares embedded mode so the module marker stays bare, and the freeze slot is born vacant: it rejects every holder-path caller until the admin appoints the first holder via `freeze_authority_transfer`, the same path that repopulates a renounced slot. There is no initialization ordering to get right because nothing initializes. Admin's anchor bootstraps its slot next door, the caller becomes admin in the transaction that creates the account.
- **Slot markers declare the offsets.** `#[admin_slot]` and `#[freeze_slot]` each derive an offset const and a layout test, and the framework reads each slot through its const. A field added above a slot moves the derived offset with it. There is no offset kwarg, the marked field is the only source.
- **The declarations must agree.** A struct carrying `#[freeze_slot]` with no instruction carrying `#[freeze_initialize]` refuses to build, the marked field declares embedded mode with nothing anchoring it. An anchored instruction with no marked field refuses too. Neither declaration is plain dedicated mode.
- **One account per transaction.** When admin and freeze share the embedding account, management instructions that read both carry the shared account once. `freeze_authority_renounce` drops from 3 accounts to 2.
- **Splice-only writes.** Freeze operations write only the 33 byte window (32 byte slot plus the frozen flag), your neighboring fields survive every toggle and transfer.
- **Offsets never appear in a transaction.** They compile into the program, and the IDL carries no offset arguments.

The library repository ships `freeze-authority-sample-embedded` with the full layout, adjacent-window tests, and a committed dry-run walkthrough.

## Verify your integration

After building your program, check that the freeze instructions appear in the IDL:

```bash
spel generate-idl path/to/your/program/src/main.rs | jq '.instructions[].name'
```

Expected output includes:

```
"admin_initialize"
"admin_transfer"
"admin_renounce"
"freeze_initialize"
"freeze_program"
"freeze_program_release"
"freeze_authority_transfer"
"freeze_authority_renounce"
"freeze_account"
"freeze_account_release"
```

Plus your own instructions. In embedded mode neither `admin_initialize` nor `freeze_initialize` appears, and the config accounts in every instruction are your own embedding account instead of the dedicated PDAs. If the freeze instructions are missing, the most common causes are:

- `freeze-authority` not declared as a path or git dependency in your `Cargo.toml`.
- `admin-authority` missing (freeze-authority hard-depends on it).
- `#[freeze_authority]` placed outside `#[lez_program]` rather than inside.
- Cached macro expansion, run `cargo clean -p <your-crate>` and rebuild.

## Security notes

- **Initialization order matters.** `freeze_initialize` requires admin signature and an initialized `admin_config`. Submit both inits back to back immediately after deployment, admin first.
- **Renounce is recoverable (unlike admin).** Vacating the freeze authority slot is reversible by the admin via `freeze_authority_transfer`. Plan accordingly if your operational model assumes the role is permanent — only renouncing admin first locks it down.
- **Exempt is shallow.** A `#[freeze_exempt]` consumer function that uses `chained_call` to invoke a gated function still hits the gated function's check. Frozen-state behaviour of chained calls is determined by the called function's exemption status, not the caller's.
- **Auto mode covers all dispatched instructions.** Including admin operations? No — admin-authority's three management instructions are exempt by an explicit entry in freeze-authority's metadata. Admin can still transfer or renounce while the program is frozen. This is by design to avoid deadlock from a lost admin key during freeze.
- **Per-account PDAs persist.** Per-account freeze state writes a PDA per target. Once initialized, the PDA exists for the program's lifetime (LEZ has no close primitive). Toggling release writes `is_frozen = false`; the PDA itself stays. No rent applies in LEZ.
